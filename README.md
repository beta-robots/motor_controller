### Overview
This repository holds an Arduino library to control a DC motor from the Arduino, through a motor controller such as xx or xx

### Download
In case the Arduino libraries folder didn't exist, create it within your Arduino sketch book:
```shell
$ mkdir [somewhere]/your-sketch-book/libraries
```

Move to your Arduino libraries folder:
```shell
$ cd [somewhere]/your-sketch-book/libraries
```

Finally download the library code:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/beta-robots/motor_controller.git
```

### How To Use It
Take a look at the examples/motor_motion.ino file to play with the motor controller or get inspiration for your 
developments.
